Using IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.8

Co-Developed the algorithms for Tarot Project. 
Worked in a team of 8 where other teammates worked on the front-end and database.
In this reposotiry, I only posted the algorithm that solves the scheduling problem.

*** What is Tarot? ***
Tarot is a program that solves University TimeTabling Problem by scheduling classes 
depending on different constraints, and with some extra touches of features that 
suites Stetson University's Computer Science Department.
